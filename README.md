AI-Matrix.
=============================

This is a fast artificial intelligence data algorithm that can solve any data back into exactly what it is.

This sort of AI excels at characterizing audio waves, processing images, and solving math problems that are in higher dimensions, such as quantum physics problems.

It allows you to design javascripts that build and create their own code or functions using the get function method.

You can also create sets with set parameters and have it align to the best answer possible given your data.

You can also use it to translate data from a function into its smallest math function.

# Web application: <a href="https://recoskie.github.io/AI-Matrix/">Link</a>

The web application lets you enter values or data to analyze.

It also lets you run your own custom code.

The basics wiki page shows how to use the AI-Matrix script in detail.

You can always learn using the interactive examples page if you find it difficult to use or understand.

# Interactive examples: <a href="https://recoskie.github.io/AI-Matrix/docs/Examples.html">Link</a>

You can learn by examples using the interactive examples page.

# How it works: <a href="https://recoskie.github.io/AI-Matrix/docs/Matrix%20Structure.html">Link</a>

On the How it Works page, you can learn how the algorithm works. It's unified structure of all things. How it solves all things in quantum alignment. Which reviles all things in any data instantly.

# Practical uses.

You can develop audio-enhancing algorithms and picture-enhancing algorithms.  

In order to build a chatbot, you would have to build a language interface for it.

Lastly, you are going to have to store data if you want it to remember and to self-learn. Which is known as building a data model.

Having an AI build a data model to work with and to analyze and bias data can be time-consuming.

However, when it comes to analyzing data into what it is to put into your data model or solving data and calculations, it is ultra-fast.
