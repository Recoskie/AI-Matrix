An program to artificially solve all kinds of data.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Matrix can be used to improve performance of functions that use loops to calculate results, and more into simple calculations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solve as Powers:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solves an set of numbers as Sums to the next number as Summation inside Summation as each pow is another dimension added up by the last dimension geometrically any number of times.

To the programmer this means Basically an loop adding up values, or an loop inside an loop adding up increment values any number of loops inside one another. Circles, and curves, gravity, quadratics, polynomials, and wave functions. More simply put think an penny plus an penny more each day as the first loop, and second as an penny plus an penny more each day plus an penny more each plus the last continues. Think of gravity acceleration as 33ft rounded per second per second as the same thing. We can do all of this with loops, or an simple calculation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solve as Geo:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solve things that multiply by two per value, or by three, or both sets are existent in the data.
Cell growth, Base number conversion eg binary digits are in multiples of twos, decimal is in multiples of 10 per value.
Basically Number patterns rather then Curves. Or chemical cell growths.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solve as Geo/Pow:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solves data as both set types.

Powers:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any set of data solved as powers will only solve properly if it is plus one number higher than the number of sumitations inside one another, or largest power in an given set. Basically X to the power of 7 will only solve properly as 8 numbers as there are 7 sum-able multiplies. The set can be an combination of any powers lower than 7 multiplied, or divided by any size, and you will only need 8 numbers to solve to the last multiply in the set. You can go higher than 8 numbers, but all that will happen is that the numbers in the set higher up will cancel out when the last sum to the last multiple is calculated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Geo:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The same concept as Powers except we are going "number" to the power of X. The largest number to the power of X will be plus one to number of results needed. You can go higher than, but all that will happen is that the numbers in the set higher up will cancel out till 0 when the last multiple to the last sum is calculated in reverse.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Geo&Pow:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This solves both backwards, and forwards in the set. Thus links the result to an intercepting central matrix of both matrices. The Highest Power plus Highest Geo in the set plus one is the required number of results to solve the set properly. You can go higher than the required set of numbers, and still solve the set as the rest of the numbers to the center of the set cancel out to 0.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Suffers from fractional error as computers can not do perfect float arithmetic thus we end up with terms that sould be 0, but are at the value of EPSILON.
