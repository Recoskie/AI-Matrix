AI-Matrix.
=============================

This is a fast artificial intelligence data algorithm that can solve any data back into exactly what it is.

This sort of AI excels at characterizing audio waves, processing images, and solving math problems that are in higher dimensions, such as quantum physics problems.

It allows you to design javascripts that build and create their own code or functions using the get function method.

You can also create sets with set parameters and have it align to the best answer possible given your data.

You can also use it to translate data from a function into its smallest math function.

# Web application: <a href="https://recoskie.github.io/AI-Matrix/">Link</a>

The web application lets you enter values or data to analyze.

It also lets you run your own custom code.

# Refrence: <a href="https://github.com/Recoskie/AI-Matrix/wiki/Basics">Link</a>

The basics wiki page shows how to use the AI-Matrix script in detail.

You can always learn using the interactive examples page if you find it difficult to use or understand.

# Interactive examples: <a href="https://recoskie.github.io/AI-Matrix/docs/Examples.html">Link</a>

You can learn by examples using the interactive examples page.

# How it works: <a href="https://recoskie.github.io/AI-Matrix/docs/Matrix%20Structure.html">Link</a>

On the How it Works page, you can learn how the algorithm works. It's unified structure of all things. How it solves all things in quantum alignment. Which reviles all things in any data instantly.

# Practical uses.

You can develop audio-enhancing algorithms and picture-enhancing algorithms.

However, if you want it to do more than just solve complex problems, or analyze data, or translate data back into the smallest possible math function.

You will have to store data if you want it to remember. You can have it bias data and self-learn. Which is known as having it build a data model.

Having an AI build a data model to work with can be time-consuming. There is a way to shorten the learning process depending on what you intend to use it for.

In order to build a chatbot, you would want to build a language interface for it. You can have it work with language directly from data only, but having it work with a language interface will allow you to have a smaller data models and to use it immediately to solve problems without a data model.

It is also well known that when AI builds its own data model, you end up with no two AI systems that are the same, much like each person. It can even seem to develop emotions learned from other's data and exist as part of the data model. Whether it seems real or is just data is for you to decide. The biggest problem with AI is how long it takes to build a data model. It can actually run on slow computers and cell phones.

There may be even more uses for artificial intelligence data algorithms and machine learning than I have put here that you may want to use it for.
